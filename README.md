Random Number Generator

This project was inspired by a need to select a number of applicants into the robotics club I run at my local elementary school. I expect a large number of applicants, but can only accept 18 students into each session.

The generator allows a user to specify how many numbers should be returned, as well as the range of numbers to include in possible results.
